We believe that each individual child is important and our mission is to help enhance their fullest potential in their academic journeys. At FIYF we aren't just the child's tutors but also their mentors and friends. We want the children to make sure that they always have someone to support them in their educational venture. We also help take a weight off the teachers shoulders by providing extra support for each child.</p>
